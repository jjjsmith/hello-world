My first github repository

Hello Humans,

This is my first edit of my first file of my second branch of my first repository.  My first branch being master.

I researched the file extension ".md" and discovered that "md" stands for "Markdown", and the file type represents a lightweight markup language with simple text formatting syntax.  The Markdown syntax was created by John Gruber, but as you'll see in the Wikipedia article, it has taken on multiple variants.


I'll use some basic Markdown markup in my changes here in this document.


Here is a main heading - Basic Markdown Syntax
========================================================


Here's a sub-heading - A few links describing Markdown
------------------------------------------------------

Followed by a bulleted list:

* Here's Gruber's website explaining all about Markdown:  

[link](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

  
* Here's the Wikipedia link describing the Markdown extension:  

[link](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)


Here's another sub-heading - Showing a Numbered List
----------------------------------------------------

1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three


And that's all you get for now.  Peruse the links for lots more helpful info.  

As for me, I'm going to get back to the business of finishing my first git update.


Bye,
Josh
